# Firework-Simulator

## About
Roman candle firework simluator developed during a Java course. Allows the user to manipulate wind speed, wind direction, and launch angle before the animation starts or at any point during the animation. A negative number for wind speed results in wind to travel from right to left, and reverse for positive numbers. A negative number for launch angle will launch the star to the left. The animation can be restarted by pressing the play button agin.

A runnable jar is in the release folder. This is not an actual release ready version. The runnable jar is solely for the convenience of trying out the program without needing to build the project or having an environment such as Eclipse.

## TODO
1. Make use of graphics card to render particles.
2. Add an explosion for when the star dies.
3. Add sound effects.
4. Add multiple fireworks.
5. Improve GUI.
